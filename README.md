test.ipynb will be mainly used for the captsone project.

K-MEANS CLUSTERING - is an iterative algorithm until the algorithm converges. It returns clusters with minimum error or most dense clusters:
  To cluster location data we will be using the k-means clustering algrotihm. 
  K-means clustering is a type of partitioning clustering.
  it divides the non-overlapping data into subsets without any cluster-internal structure.
  Examples within a cluster are very similar.
  Examples across different clusters are very different.
  
Determining the number of centroid for clusters is a challenging problem.
 To determine the centroid coordinates, we can use 2 approaches:
  randomly pick n number of data points from the data set.
  create n number of random data points
  
Make a distance matrix to determine to which centroid does each data point belong.

Error for the clustering model can be found using sum of squared differences between each point and its centroid (SSE).
